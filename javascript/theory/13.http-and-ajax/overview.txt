ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION: 
- it always returns a promise and we  need to resolve it
- contains 'await' expression
- await replaces '.then()'
- await resolves a promise

A FUNCTION CAN BE ASYNCHRONOUS either because it is written with the async await syntax
or because it executes asynchronous action

In an asynchronous function the code will be executed synchronously - row by row 
but if the row contains an asynchronous action it will be executed asynchronously
