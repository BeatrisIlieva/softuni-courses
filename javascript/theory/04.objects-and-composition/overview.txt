Arrays are collections that is meant to contain a list of uniform data. 

An object is a collection of non uniform data that is related to one and the same thing.
The keys are always a string. 
Values can be af any type.

Objects are a reference data type. 

Reference data type - the variable holds a reference to the value that is kept in the heap.

In JS arrays have indices which are integers, the object have properties which are strings. 
The value can be of any type.

Objects are created with object literal.

There are two types of memory. Stack and Heap. The stack is memory dedicated for the runtime 
execution of our program. The heap is the memory of the machine. When we create a variable 
and assign it a value of primitive type, both the variable and the value are kept in the 
stack. When we assign to a variable a value of reference type, the variable stays in the stack.
The value is kept in the heap. So the variable holds a reference to where the object
is located in memory.
