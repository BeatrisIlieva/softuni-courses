/* 
    In JS the values have types not the variables
    / Literal is the way we write down a given value 
      so the interpreted can understand of what type it is /
    - string literal '' to define a string 
    - array literal [] to define an array
    - object literal {} to define an object
    - just a digit 5 to define number
    - true/false to define a boolean

    Thus, the interpreter understands what the type is from the literal

    The variable is a just a container for the value.
