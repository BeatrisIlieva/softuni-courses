                            Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small
                            minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that
                            you can become great too.

                            Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction
                            in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are
                            capable.

                            Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The
                            ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational
                            objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon
                            results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a
                            team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.
