Arrays are a structure data should contain uniform data. They provide us with the flexibility
to store, iterate or access large amount of uniform data. For example, it is much easier
to declare a variable 'firstNames' and to assign it as a value an array that 
contains all the names compared to creating a separate variable for each first name.

In JS nor the length of an array is fixed, nor the value types it contains. 

When comparing reference types, the comparison is not by value but by reference;

The reason why methods like reverse and others return the reference 
is because this allows us to make chaining

reverse() and sort() return the same reference; they are mutating methods

a callback function does not return a result but executes an action over an element

It is not  a good practice to use forEach and for ... of when we modify the elements

Predicate is a function that accepts an input and returns a boolean
