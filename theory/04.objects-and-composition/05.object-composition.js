/*
    Object composition happens when we combine reference data types -> object inside objects,
    arrays inside objects, objects inside arrays, arrays inside arrays.
    Object composition allows us to reuse code. It is considered superior to OOP inheritance.

    In object Composition, objects are described by what they DO, not by what they ARE.
